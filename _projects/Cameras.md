I don’t exactly remember how I convinced my parents that I needed a two-thousand-dollar camera in high school. It had something to do with all the travel we did and how I liked documenting our vacations. My first camera was a Nikon Z6, one of the early mirrorless models, and I did an absurd amount of research (brand, color science, ergonomics) to make sure it was the best camera for me.

In college, after a summer of making enough money to travel, I took one of my first trips to Germany. I left the Z6 at home; I was backpacking, sleeping in hostels, and hiking, and I wasn’t about to babysit an expensive toy. Then one day in Berlin, I walked past a camera store and found a beat-up Nikon N8008S with a 35mm lens for under 100 euros. I didn’t overthink it. I bought the camera and a single 24-exposure roll of Kodak Portra 400. Those 24 frames became the trip’s core memory. I can still see Berlin in Portra’s colors. Film, unfortunately, was too expensive to keep up with, and the camera eventually died.

In 2022, I spent a summer at Georgia Tech as a research assistant, and my first real paycheck went toward a used Fujifilm X100T. By then I was obsessed with the colors a camera could produce straight out of the box. It wasn’t that the top-of-the-line Z6 couldn’t make vibrant photos, but I’d grown fond of colors that weren’t perfectly true to life. I wanted personality. On paper, the X100T was a downgrade from the Z6, but in practice it lived in my pocket. It went with me to Iceland, London, Switzerland, and Korea, and I loved the photos it gave me. Unfortunately, the unique colors the camera gave me somehow became very popular on social media and lost a bit of their uniqueness, but that’s okay… I guess.

Now, as a PhD student, I honestly don’t care about specs. I just want to record my life the way it is. My life isn’t professional; it’s a collection of amateur decisions and comfortable daily mundanities that I happen to like. A professional camera doesn’t care about any of that. I need something modest that simply shows up. A phone would be convenient, but the software feels too artificial, and I want a camera I can bring everywhere—even underwater sometimes. It’s been four years since my last camera purchase. As great as the Fuji was, it’s ready to retire. So I’m welcoming the Pentax WG-8. Consider this my essay as a justification for spending the money.
