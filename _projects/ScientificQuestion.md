As a PhD student, I have to come up with "worthy" scientific ideas. By worthy, I don't mean to imply other ideas are unworthy, but rather that I'm seeking ideas that are not immediately liable to be overturned by the steady progress of technology. For example, if I were a remote scientist in 2019 interested in determining Martian sediment chemistry from satellite data, I would, in some sense, be fighting against the 2020 Mars Rover's "data update." My conclusions, based on coarser satellite data, would likely be rendered obsolete or simply proven inferior to those from the direct rover measurements.

However, not all science is like this. A really amazing example where the science is invariant to technology is Bouvard’s postulation of Neptune (without observing it!) to explain the anomalies in Uranus’s orbit. His discovery is purely from physics, instead of data. The same holds for Mendeleev. Rather than just cataloging known elements, he used the idea of periodicity to postulate the existence of unobserved elements to complete the periodic table, "correcting" the data to fit the theory.

At first, one appears data-driven and one appears physics-driven (?); however, I don’t think this contrast is the reason the second science feels more worthy to me. Instead, I think the pitfall for data-driven science comes from a fundamental issue in statistics. Any finite set of data can be explained by countless competing hypotheses. A statistical method, like regression, is simply a tool designed to find a "best-fit" for the data it is given. In other words, it will always converge to some conclusion, which we then mistake for the "most logical" or simplest answer in an Occam’s razor sense. The problem is that this "best-fit" is often just a local optimum, an artifact of the noise and technological limitations of that specific dataset, rather than a map of the truth.

From this perspective, Bouvard’s postulation of an unobserved planet or Mendeleev’s inclusion of unobserved elements is far from this kind of data-driven convergence. They were positing entities that the data, constrained by current technology, simply could not "see." Their conclusions, by logic, existed in the "delay" before a "better" technology could come along and confirm them. This highlights a  tension in how Occam’s razor is applied. A simplistic, data-first application would reject Bouvard’s new planet as an "unnecessary entity." But while the razor is right in most senses, it becomes a liability when it privileges the simplest fit to limited data over a hypothesis that, while temporarily more complex, is demanded by a deeper physical principle. If a hypothesis follows from sound physics, it is not impossible simply because it is not yet the most parsimonious fit to the data.
