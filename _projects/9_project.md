How can the fractal dimension, a fundamental 3D geometric property, be accurately inferred from 2D projections of flocs? This challenge highlights the inherent loss of information when transitioning from higher-dimensional data to lower-dimensional representations.

## Synthetic Fractal Aggregates and Fractal Dimension Calculation

We generate synthetic fractal aggregates and compute their fractal dimension using the **Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm**.

## CNN-Based Prediction of Fractal Dimension

We train a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** to predict the fractal dimension using 2D input images.  
We found that applying various levels of **Gaussian blur** improves prediction accuracy.
