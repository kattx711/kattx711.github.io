              **River migration hazard forecasting:** Built Bayesian models and Monte Carlo simulations to predict river migration, delivering probabilistic hazard forecasts with quantified uncertainty for infrastructure risk assessment; presented at the [2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFMEP35A..06N/abstract) and [2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AGUFMEP21D..01W/abstract) AGU Annual Meetings.

              **Floc structure quantification:** Developed a stratified image analysis pipeline to infer 3D fractal dimensions of mud flocs from 2D imaging. Demonstrated that standard aggregation overestimates density, improving sediment transport prediction in aquatic environments.
