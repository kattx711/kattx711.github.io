Hi, I'm Katia Avanesov and I'm a junior at the California Institute of Technology double majoring in Physics and Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy making art, and I hope to bridge my passion for art and STEM through projects in software design, data visualisation, and modelling. 

I have been a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment at CERN since 2023, where I have been working under the mentorship of Professor Harvey Newman (Caltech) and Dr. Kiley Kennedy (Princeton), and developing machine-learning-based techniques to detect and classify [Long-Lived Particles](https://github.com/kattx711/Run3-HCAL-LLP-Analysis/). I have also been involved in several other projects involving machine learning such as developing an anomaly detection system for [automating CERN's Data Quality Monitoring](https://github.com/kattx711/ML4DQM/) or analysing anomalies in [computer-numerical-controlled processes](https://github.com/kattx711/Anomaly-Detection-for-CNC-Machining).
