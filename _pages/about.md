Hi, I’m **Katia Avanesov**, a double major in **Physics** and **Computer Science** at the **California Institute of Technology**.

Since 2024, I’ve worked with the **Princeton CMS Group** at **CERN**, developing machine-learning classifiers for particle detection and contributing to a real-time anomaly-detection system for LHC data-quality monitoring.

Beyond particle physics, I build full-stack technical systems, including a minimal **Java Virtual Machine**, a **C-based physics engine** for game design, and algorithms for anomaly and wear detection in high-frequency sensor data. I’m broadly interested in computational systems that are efficient, elegant, and grounded in strong physical or mathematical reasoning.
