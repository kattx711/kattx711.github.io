Hi, I’m **Brayden Noh**, a PhD student in **Earth and Planetary Sciences** at **Harvard University**, where I am advised by [Brendan Meade](https://brendanjmeade.github.io/). My research focuses on earthquake cycles and the interactions between tectonic deformation and landscape evolution, combining physical process modeling with statistical approaches.

I completed my undergraduate studies at **Caltech**, where I worked with [Michael Lamb](https://lamb.caltech.edu/), [Omar Wani](https://www.omarwani.com/), [Karl Lang](https://www.karllang.info/), and [Vinamra Agrawal](https://vinagr.github.io/) on projects ranging from asteroid impact simulations to probabilistic geomorphic risk modeling.
