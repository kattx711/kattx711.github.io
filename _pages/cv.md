## Research Experience

**Caltech** — Arthur R. Adams SURF Fellow, Saul and Joan Cogen Memorial SURF Fellow
*Pasadena, CA* — *Dec 2021 – Jul 2025*

* **River migration hazard forecasting:** Built Bayesian models and Monte Carlo simulations to predict river migration, delivering probabilistic hazard forecasts with quantified uncertainty for infrastructure risk assessment; presented at the [2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFMEP35A..06N/abstract) and [2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AGUFMEP21D..01W/abstract) American Geophysical Union (AGU) Annual Meetings. See: “Geomorphic risk maps for river migration using probabilistic modeling – a framework.”
* **Floc structure quantification:** Developed a stratified image analysis pipeline to infer 3D fractal dimensions of mud flocs from 2D imaging. Demonstrated that standard aggregation overestimates density, improving sediment transport prediction in aquatic environments. See: “Constraining the Distribution of 3D Fractal Structures in Mud Flocs.”

**TECHtonics Research Group, Georgia Tech** — NSF REU Researcher
*Atlanta, GA* — *May 2023 – Jul 2023*

* **Sediment transport analysis:** Developed UAV-based remote sensing and sediment transport modeling techniques to estimate paleo-discharge in mountainous tropical rivers, advancing quantitative reconstructions of past river flows and hydrologic variability; presented at the [2023 AGU Annual Meeting](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AGUFMEP41D2387N/abstract).

**Mechanics of Materials Laboratory, Auburn University** — Researcher
*Auburn, AL* — *Aug 2020 – Nov 2021*

* **Impact crater simulation and visualization:** Modeled asteroid atmospheric entry and crater formation with the iSALE hydrocode. Visualized how porosity and asteroid properties control breakup and surface impact. Produced [award-winning Python visualizations](https://agu.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/107/details/21843) recognized by the 2021 AGU Michael H. Freilich Student Visualization Competition and presented at the [2022 Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPSC...16...73N/abstract).
